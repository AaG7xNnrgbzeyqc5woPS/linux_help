# Last word.
  So, which one is the “best”? Well, it will depend on what do you want to achieve. AppImages are the best choice for end user content distribution and desktop oriented computing. Flatpak will shine when you use only one desktop environment, whereas Snappy is the best choice for IoT devices on which the vendor must ensure that the device will work without or with small user interaction; and snaps implement automatic updates.

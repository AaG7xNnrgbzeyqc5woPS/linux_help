## 1. [Hidden //$HOME//snap])(https://cialu.net/how-to-move-snap-folder-away-from-home-location-in-linux/)
    So, in the end, the most fashionable solution I found is the following: hide the snap folder!
    $ touch .hidden # create a .hidden file in the $HOME directory
    $ vim .hidden # edit the .hidden file and put the word 'snap' in it
    snap
    :wq # to save and close the file in vim
    Now, your ‘snap’ folder is disappeared from the home directory.

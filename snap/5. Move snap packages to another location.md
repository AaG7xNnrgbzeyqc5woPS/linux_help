  Tests and trials will continue in the coming days/months and, of course, we will keep you updated. Having said that, there is one thing we really can’t stand on about the snap system: a folder named ‘snap’ and placed inside the ‘home’ folder. Wow; what an intrusive (and ugly) thing that doesn’t follow any (please, take a look here: The Linux Filesystem Hierarchy) of the Linux filesystem organization guidelines! 

The /snap directory is, by default, where the files and folders from installed snap packages appear on your system.

From the official documentation, it has the following structure:

    /snap/bin - Symlinks to snap applications
    /snap/<snapname>/<revision> - Mountpoint for snap content
    /snap/<snapname>/current - Symlink to current revision, if enabled

  But you also find a ‘snap’ folder in your home directory, it has dedicated to snap applications’ settings, caches and more. And it is ugly to see it in your home folder.

  A lot of people are demanding ‘how to move the snap folder to another location’, but it seems something like impossible without broking the snap system. AskUbuntu and LaunchPad bug for references.

  So, in the end, the most fashionable solution I found is the following: hide the snap folder!
    
    #--------------------- main ------------------
    $ touch .hidden # create a .hidden file in the $HOME directory
    $ vim .hidden # edit the .hidden file and put the word 'snap' in it
    snap
    :wq # to save and close the file in vim
    Now, your ‘snap’ folder is disappeared from the home directory.
